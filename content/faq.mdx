## FAQ for Hosts

Q: _Where can I find the full details of the regulations?_  
A: This is the official document: http://www.honolulu.gov/dppstr/default.html

Q: _Which areas are classified as "Resort Areas"?_  
A: “Resort areas” are limited to only some sections within Waikiki, Koolina, and Turtle Bay Resort.

Q: _If I set a minimum stay of 30 days, will it be OK to continue to advertise on Airbnb or VRBO?_  
A: No. Both Airbnb and VRBO show a nightly rate. This is specifically

Q: _Can I continue to advertise my Transient Vacation Unit?_  
A:After August 1, 2019, only if the dwelling has a NUC or is located in a resort area, you can continue advertising. If you do not have a NUC or your property is not in a resort area, then you can advertise your property with minimum 30 days stay rule.

Q: _How do I distinguish my legal long-term rental advertisement from an illegal short-term rental?_  
A: Specify in the ad that the rental period is a minimum of 30 days or more. Do not include any rental rates of less than a monthly basis.

Q:_I am advertising my Transient Vacation Unit with 30 days minimum stay rule, but the platform I use is showing the nightly rate, even though the minimum stay is 30 days. Will I be liable?_  
A:Yes, you may be cited for illegally advertising. If the platform is unwilling to change its policy, you may have to decide whether to continue participating on that platform.

Q: _What are the fines for illegal advertising?_  
A: Owners of the property involved in illegal advertising will be notified, and if the advertisement is taken down in 7 days, no fine will be imposed for a first offense. If not taken down within this deadline, fines of between $1,000 and $10,000 can be imposed for each day the advertisement remains on display.

Q: _When will the department start enforcing the new advertising restrictions?_  
A: Beginning on August 1, 2019.

Q: _If the management company for my property places an illegal ad, will the company get cited?_  
A: They may be cited, but Ord. 19-18 says, “The burden of proof is on the owner of the subject real property to establish that the property is not being used as a bed and breakfast home or transient vacation unit or that the advertisement was placed without the property owner’s knowledge or consent.”

Q: _To comply with the law, people will be advertising only 30-day stays. But, in follow-up conversations, they will offer daily and weekly stays. How will you know who’s doing this to skirt the law?_  
A: Advertising is a new violation, but actually staying in a home for less than 30 days is still a violation. The DPP will continue to monitor for occupancy violations. Also, just as a caution to homeowners, Governor David Ige recently signed House Bill No. 807 (Act 114), which makes it a misdemeanor offense to knowingly make a false statement to a county inspector. This is not something that we plan to use, but it is a tool in our enforcement toolkit.

Q: _My property is in a resort area, can I continue advertising for less than 30 days?_  
A: Technically, yes. But you need to display your property license in your advertisement, otherwise, you might get a warning. Ord. 19-18 only requires those with NUCs to include the NUC number in advertisements beginning August 1, 2019.

## FAQ for Guests

Q: _I've already booked a stay of fewer than 30 days. Will this affect my booking?_  
A:We encourage you to contact your homeowner about this topic.

## Economic effects

Q: _Who will benefit from the enforcement of the regulations_  
A: The county will get revenue from the fines. Hotels will almost certainly see increased demand and may be able to increase both occupancy and rates. Homebuyers may benefit from a decrease in real estate values.

Q: _Who will be adversely affected by the enforcement of Oahu Ordinance 19-18?_  
A: Owners and managers of properties which are currently offered as tourist accommodation for stays of less than 30 days.

## REGISTRATION OF NEW BED AND BREAKFAST HOMES

Q: _I have been operating a Bed and Breakfast Home for several years. Do I still have to obtain a registration number?_  
A: Yes, unless you already have a NUC.

Q: _I only rent out my house for more than 30 days at a time. Do I need to register?_  
A: No.

Q: _I only rent my house while my family spends 2 weeks each year visiting family on the mainland. Do I need to register?_  
A: Yes.

Q: _When can I register?_  
A: Registration will begin on October 1, 2020, although we are considering a preregistration process before then.

Q: _Why do we have to wait more than a year to register?_  
A: The time is required for the Department to develop more specific procedures for implementing Ord. 19-18, including the adoption of rules, and creating the software to help with enforcement and the registration process. If necessary, it provides time to acquire more staff and to train them. For applicants, it may take time for them to fulfill some of the filing requirements, such as obtaining their AOAO approval, if applicable.

Q: _What are the registration requirements?_  
A: There are more than a dozen requirements. Most notable:

- Applicants must be “natural persons,” and not an organization or company
- Applicants must have a home exemption granted under real property tax law
- There must be insurance coverage for bed and breakfast use
- The initial registration fee is $1,000. For annual renewals, the fee is $2,000
- No more than 2 bedrooms can be used for visitor accommodations
- Quiet hours must be observed between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.
- If part of a homeowners or apartment owners association, approval by that association must be obtained
- Neighbors within 250 feet must be given a phone number to contact to make complaints, 24 hours a day
  For the complete list of requirements, refer to Ord. 19-18: https://bit.ly/2IS637x

Q: _I heard that the NUC program will be discontinued and we will no longer be able to renew a NUC. Is that true?_  
A: No, the NUC program will continue, as usual, meaning they have to be renewed every even-numbered year. Ord. 19-18 only requires those with NUCs to include the NUC number in advertisements beginning August 1, 2019.

Q: _Where can I find a list of NUCs?_  
A: For a complete list, please click on this link: https://bit.ly/30wM6Jm

Q: _Are there other requirements?_  
A: Density Limit. No more than 0.5% of the total number of dwelling units in each regional development plan area (DPA) can be used as B&Bs. Here are the limits by area:

<OahuMap />

New B&Bs are not allowed in the North Shore area, based on directives of the North Shore Sustainable

Communities Plan: http://bit.ly/2Y4QpLg Condominium Limit. Up to 50% of units in a condominium building may be allowed a B&B, subject to AOAO approval.

Separation Minimum. B&Bs must be at least 1,000 feet from each other. This does not apply to units in resort areas and NUCs. Clearly, there is a conflict between the condo limit and this separation limit. While we are still looking into it, this may practically result in only 1 unit per building.

Nontransferable. Registration numbers are not transferable to another property, nor transferable to another homeowner.

Renewal Criteria. Noise and other nuisance complaints can be grounds to deny renewal requests.

For the complete list of requirements, refer to Bill 89 CD2: https://bit.ly/2IS637x

Q: _How long will it take to get registered?_  
A: It is not yet determined. An online registration process is anticipated, but certain requirements will have to be verified; e.g. compliance with parking requirements

Q: _If only a limited number of registration numbers will be given out, how can I guarantee to get one?_  
A: There is no provision for guarantees.

Q: _How will it be determined who gets a registration number?_  
A: Generally on first-come, first-served basis. If the number of requests exceeds the limit for a DPA, then a lottery will be held.

Q: _How will the lottery system work?_  
A: This will be fleshed out in the Rules. There will be a public hearing on the draft Rules before they are finalized.

Q: _I am currently operating a B&B, and do not have a NUC, so will need to register. Will I get priority in the registration process?_  
A: No

Q: _Can I advertise and operate a short-term rental once I file my registration?_  
A: No. To avoid a citation, operation cannot occur until the registration process has been completed and registration number issued.

Q: _I pay my taxes for the rental I have, doesn’t that make me legal?_  
A: No, not necessarily. If you are renting the unit for 30 days or more, you are legal. If you have a NUC, or are in the resort area, you are legal. Otherwise, you are likely operating an illegal vacation rental.

Q: _I have bookings through the rest of the year. What should I do?_  
A: If you are legally operating, you can go about your business as usual. If you are renting for less than 30 days, don’t have a NUC, aren’t in a resort area, the decision is yours as to whether to continue the illegal use. But beginning August 1, we will vigorously enforce Ord. 19-18.
