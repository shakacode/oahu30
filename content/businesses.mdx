**Who will benefit from the enforcement of the regulations?**  
The county will get revenue from the fines but that is balanced by the additional costs of employing inspectors, developing and running new systems and searching for illegal rentals.  
Hotels will almost certainly see increased demand and may be able to increase both occupancy and rates.  
Homebuyers may benefit from a decrease in real estate values.

**Who will be adversely affected by the enforcement of Oahu Ordinance 19-18?**  
- Owners and managers of properties which are currently offered as tourist accommodation for stays of less than 30 days
- Providers of services such as cleaning, garden maintenance, pool maintenance, property management
- Home sellers who may suffer from a reduction in real estate values
- Tourist activity providers who may see a decrease in custom
- Independent restaurants and catering establishments who may see a decrease in custom

**Can the 30-day Oahu regulations meet the objectives in terms of making more housing available to local people?**  
In Waikiki, it probably will make apartments a little more affordable for long-term rental as owners are forced to switch from short-term to long-term and this will increase supply on the long-term rental market, resulting in a small decrease in rental rates and an increase in availability. However, the majority of Oahu's former short term rental properties are at the high end of the market. Removing these from the short-term rental market can have no effect on availability of housing for families who are currently struggling to find decent housing.
